							<p>Our team has guitar luthiers with over 10 years of experience who are completely passionate about the art of creating <span class="yellow-text">high-quality instruments</span> with <span class="yellow-text">top-notch performance</span>. We are always busy sketching guitar designs, sourcing raw woods and materials, spraying guitars in our paint booth, and fine-tuning, testing, and playing our guitars prior to shipping them out to customers all around the world. We've made it <span class="yellow-text">fun</span>, <span class="yellow-text">efficient</span> and <span class="yellow-text">affordable</span> for folks to design, purchase and play their very own pro-grade custom guitar.<br><br>Together we will go over every detail, from size and shape, to bindings and rosette design, to pick­ups and tuners. Here at Cithara we build handcrafted acoustic guitars that are unique to each player’s vision and style.
